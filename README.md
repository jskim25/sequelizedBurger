# burger
Week 15 homework

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Materialize framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user can add a burger to the "menu". This adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database, so the data is persistent. The page should automatically load with the user's inputted burger once they click on the submit. Then, the user can choose to "devour" the burger. This changes the boolean value of the data entry and moves the burger to a different section of the page.

## Getting Started
Run the node server locally.

## Prerequisites
Please check the package.json file.
